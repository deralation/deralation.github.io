My name is Gokhan Derala, Software Developer in YOYO car rental startup from Istanbul, Turkey.

My pathway is rather atypical. I made an important change in my professional life, by turning towards a quite new career in web development.

I had more than 6 years of experience in the Finance field, first in Aytek, an international Construction company in Muscat (Oman) than in Publik / Adphorus, a SaaS startup in Istanbul (Turkey).

By starting working in Publik / Adphorus, I discovered the field of Digital Agency and became closer to the technical teams. My interest in their work became grew more and more, and I quickly started to learn to code myself.

I resigned for becoming a software developer, which is a new generation of craftsmanship. I always felt like I had to learn how to create something. I always had a feeling I was meant to be more creative, that I had to build something by myself and Finance could not satisfy this need. 

I decided to learn to code by myself and I decided to go deep and I joined le wagon Software Development Bootcamp in Brussels which is 9 weeks intense software programming boot camp basically focus on Ruby on Rails, Ruby, Heroku, PostgreSQL, JS, Jquery and MVC methodologies.

Right now I am working in [YOYO](https://driveyoyo.com) as a Software Developer since April 2016. YOYO comprise a membership organisation that provides self-service vehicle use by the hour or by the day. The Company places vehicles in convenient parking spaces throughout major metropolitan areas and universities in Turkey. Through the use of the Company's proprietary software and hardware, members are able to reserve vehicles online, through a wireless mobile device or by phone, access the vehicle with an electronic pass card or mobile device, and receive automatic billings.

In this period of my programming career, I would like to focus on Front End Technologies like React, Redux React, Webpack and ES6 technologies and Test Driven Development methodologies integrations tests and unit tests as well. 
Please contact me by phone or email at your earliest convenience. I look forward to hearing from you and thank you for your time. Please find attached the Resume.
