My name is Gokhan Derala. I am a Software Developer based out of Istanbul, Turkey. I am currently working as a Software Developer for Mawlin, a sales channel that allows manufacturers to sell their products directly to the end consumer. 

My pathway is rather atypical. I made an important change in my professional life, by turning away from a career in finance towards one in Software Development.

I had worked for more than six years in the field of finance, beginning with Aytek, an international Construction company in Muscat, Oman and then continuing on with Publik / Adphorus, a SaaS startup based out of Istanbul, Turkey.

It was my experience working for Publik / Adphorus that led me to change my career. In my position as a finance specialist for the digital agency I became more engaged with the technical team and my interest in their work grew exponentially from there. Eventually, my curiosity turned into passion and I quickly started to learn to code.

I resigned from my position as finance specialist to pursue a life as a software developer, which I believe to be one of the most important jobs in today's global labour market. This has allowed me to tap into my creative talents in a way that the field of finance did not allow. 

Initially, I began to teach myself how to code and then ultimately decided to join Le Wagon's Software Development Bootcamp in Brussels, Belgium. The focus of this 9 week intensive software programming was on Ruby on Rails, Ruby, Heroku, PostgreSQL, JS, Jquery and MVC methodologies.

After the boot camp, I returned to Istanbul, where I took my first position as a Software Developer in 2016 with [YOYO](https://driveyoyo.com) and continued on with them until March 2020. YOYO is a membership organisation that provides short-term self-serviced vehicles either by the hour or by the day. The company places vehicles in convenient parking spaces throughout major metropolitan areas and universities in Turkey. Through the use of the company's proprietary software and hardware, members are able to reserve vehicles online, through a wireless mobile device or by phone. Access to the vehicle is then given with an electronic pass card or mobile device, and billings are then received by the company.

After working with YOYO for five years, I decided to take on a new challege and began working for [Mawlin](https://mawlin.com/) as a Software Developer as of March 2020. Mawlin is a sales channel that allows manufacturers to sell their products directly to the end consumer in North America and Europe. It is essentially service which connects local manufacturers to global markets. 

In this period of my programming career, I would like to continue to develop my skills in Front End Technologies like React, Redux React, Webpack and ES6 technologies as well as Test Driven Development methodologies, integrations tests and unit tests.
