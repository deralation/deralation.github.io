<p class='lead'>Summary</p>

I am **Software Developer** based in Istanbul / Turkey. Working in [YOYO](https://driveyoyo.com) Car Rental Industry since 2016 March.

My pathway is rather atypical. I made an important change in my professional life, by turning towards a quite new career in web development.

I had more than 6 years of experience in the Finance field, first in [Aytek](http://www.aytek.com/), an international Construction company in Muscat (Oman) than in [Publik](http://publik.com.tr/) / [Adphorus](https://adphorus.com/), a SaaS startup in Istanbul (Turkey).

By starting working in [Publik](http://publik.com.tr/) / [Adphorus](https://adphorus.com/), I discovered the field of Digital Agency and became closer to the technical teams. My interest in their work became grew more and more, and I quickly started to learn to code myself.

I resigned for becoming a software developer, which is a new generation of craftsmanship. I always felt like I had to learn how to create something. I always had a feeling I was meant to be more creative, that I had to build something by myself and Finance could not satisfy this need. 

I decided to joined Intense **Software Development Bootcamp** during 9 weeks intense software programming boot camp.

Now I am **Software Developer** and **Estonia E-Resident** focus on Tech Projects.
