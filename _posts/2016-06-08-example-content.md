<p class='lead'>Summary</p>

I am a **Software Developer** based in Istanbul, Turkey and am an Estonia E-Resident focusing specifically on tech projects. Since March 2020, I have been working for [Mawlin](https://mawlin.com), which is a sales channel that allows manufacturers to sell their products directly to the end consumer, based out of Istanbul, Turkey.

Prior to starting my career in software development, I worked in finance for six years. First, I spent over four years in Muscat, Oman, working as a finance manager for [Ay-Tek(Oman) Construction LLC](http://www.aytek.com/), which is an international construction company based in the region. Following that, I returned to Istanbul where I worked as a finance and accounting specialist for [Publik](http://publik.com.tr/) / [Adphorus](https://adphorus.com/), an SaaS start-up. 

My passion for being part of a fast-paced and continuously changing industry led me to shift my career from the finance sector to software development, which I believe is the new generation of craftsmanship. In 2015, I took the plunge and moved to Belgium to partake in an 9 week-long intensive **Software Development Bootcamp**. I haven't looked back ever since, continuing to build my knowledge of different software languages and to challenge myself to develop new products at work and in my freetime. 

I began my journey as a software developer in Istanbul with YOYO, a local car sharing start-up where I would spend the next five years. Due to the nature of the industry, I found it necessary to take the next step in my career and expand my skillset by taking on my current position with Mawlin where I work with React and PHP as a front and backend developer.
